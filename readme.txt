== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can i hide an icon? =

To hide an icon, Just dont give any value for that button link.. it will automatically gets hiden.

= Why the floating social media icon is not displaying on my page even if i made all properly? =

Our Plugin Uses Hooks to integrate the suppported javascripts styles and html to the theme. So Make sure your theme footer.php have  <?php wp_footer(); ?> and header.php have  <?php wp_head(); ?> , Most of all the plugins work with the support of this code and if this is not present on your theme.. Its your themes mistake..

= How can i integrate the  <?php wp_footer(); ?> and  <?php wp_head(); ?> to my theme if it is not present on my theme? =

It can be easily done.. Just to go Theme Editor which is under apperance and select footer.php and add  <?php wp_footer(); ?> before the closing body tag which is  </body> and then go and edit header.php and add  <?php wp_head(); ?> just before the closing head tag which is  </head>

= Can i disable the automated integration and place where ever i want? =

Yes, You can.. Just to go "Acx Social icons" Menu which is in left side on wp-admin and in that page you will find "Display Mode" option. Select it to Manual. But then there will be no animation but you can Use Our Shortcode or PHP Code to display the social media icons anywhere you want.

= What are theshortcode and php code that will display this social media icon? =

You can use the shortcode  [DISPLAY_ACURAX_ICONS] in any post or page or even in your custom post types. You can also use  <?php DISPLAY_ACURAX_ICONS(); ?> anywhere in the theme files to show this icons.(But note that manual icons display will not have the animation

= There are a lot of other social icons plugins, but why this plugin? =

Most of all the plugins have more and more options which is only easly understandable by advanced users, those have a bunch of social media profile integrations. But in our case we choosen the must to have icons and made it perfect animation and position styling.. More icons on website make it look bad.. So use the essentials with sexy display.
